STICK HERO

GROUP NUMBER: 120

DESCRIPTION: We have implemented a game inspired by Stick Hero using JavaFX and Scene Builder using the OOPs principles
taught to us throughout the semester.

We have made a character called "Stick Hero" who extends out a stick of variable length up to a fixed height.

If the height of the stick is same as the gap between the platforms.
Then, that stick rotates and becomes parallel with the platform at the same height as the platform.
The player, then traverses the gap between the platforms using this newly formed bridge.
As the player consumes more cherries, his score keeps increasing.

If the height of the stick is less than or more than the gap between the platforms, the player falls down to his death.
Game over.

We have put our heart, soul and sleep in making this game.
We hope you thoroughly enjoy it.
:)
